# Computational Logic for AI - Coursework

The goal of the coursework is to extend the reasoning capabilities of the Prolexa Q&A assistant. This [Markdown document](https://github.com/desmond-rn/ComputationalLogic/blob/prolexa-plus/Prolexa_Plus_Demo_Notebook.ipynb) explains what Prolexa is, and what she can currently do. 

We implemented three additional reasoning strategies in the already amazing Prolexa. These are Negation, Default Rule, and Existential Quantification. We compiled our findings in a carefully crafted [notebook](https://github.com/desmond-rn/ComputationalLogic/blob/prolexa-plus/Assignment%20-%20Report.ipynb) detailing our objective, our experiments, our results, a critical analysis of those results, and potential future work.
